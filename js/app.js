//==================Section 14: Comparing Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort==================

//Big 0 Sorting Algorithms

//Algorithm 		Time Complexity(Best)		Time Complexity(Avg)		Time Complexity(Worst)		Space Complexity

//Bubble Sort 		0(n)						O(n^2)						O(n^2)						O(1)
//Insertion Sort 	0(n)						O(n^2)						O(n^2)						O(1)
//Selection Sort 	O(n^2)						O(n^2)						O(n^2)						O(1)

	//Bubble sort and Insertion Sort aren't bad if the data is NEARLY SORTED
	//Selection sort goes through the entire array regardless if the data is nearly sorted or not\


	//The Space Complexity is all the same because we aren't using much space, we aren't creating new 
	//arrays, we aren't creating variables, or multiple variables for each element.

		//Check sorting algorithms animations and compare these three algorithms on nearly sorted data

	//Insertion Sort is a good option for live or constantly changing data as it sorts from beginning 
	//to end regardless of previous sort

//Recap
	//Sorting is fundamental
	//Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
	//All have average time complexities that are quadratic / O(n^2)
	//We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms!
